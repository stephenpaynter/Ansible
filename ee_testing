Ansible Automation Platform is a powerful tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. In complex organizations dealing with multiple business units, it is crucial to ensure that the execution environments are tested thoroughly to maintain consistency, security, and reliability. This technical document outlines the best practices for testing execution environments in Ansible Automation Platform while dealing with multiple business units.

Challenges with Multiple Business Units

When managing execution environments for multiple business units, some challenges may arise:

Isolation: Each business unit may have different requirements, configurations, and dependencies, making it challenging to isolate and manage them effectively.
Version Control: Coordinating and tracking changes across multiple environments can become complicated, leading to potential conflicts.
Testing: Ensuring that changes do not adversely impact other business units while verifying the desired outcomes can be difficult.
Scalability: As the number of business units grows, it becomes crucial to have an efficient and scalable testing process.
Best Practices for Testing Execution Environments

To address the challenges mentioned above, follow these best practices:

Environment Isolation
Implement strict environment isolation to prevent conflicts between business units. Use Ansible inventories to define separate environments for each unit. This way, variables, configurations, and roles specific to a business unit can be managed independently.

Version Control
Utilize version control systems like Git to manage your Ansible playbooks and roles. Each business unit's configurations and playbooks should be stored in separate branches or repositories. This allows changes to be versioned and easily tracked.

Testing Frameworks
Adopt testing frameworks like molecule to automate the testing process. Molecule allows you to define scenarios and test playbooks against different environments, ensuring the reliability of your configurations.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing and deployment of Ansible playbooks. CI/CD pipelines can be set up to test changes automatically before merging them into the production branch, reducing the risk of errors and conflicts.

Implementing the Testing Process

Define Test Scenarios
Work with each business unit to identify critical test scenarios for their specific execution environment. Test scenarios should cover various use cases, configurations, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive testing.

Create Test Playbooks
Develop test playbooks using Ansible and molecule to simulate the defined test scenarios. These playbooks should cover all aspects of the business unit's execution environment and ensure that the configurations are correct and functional.

Execute Tests
Integrate the test playbooks into your CI/CD pipeline or run them manually against each business unit's environment. Monitor the test results and address any issues that arise during testing.

Monitoring and Reporting

Implement monitoring to keep track of the execution environment's health and performance. Utilize Ansible Tower or other monitoring tools to ensure the continuous operation of the infrastructure. Generate reports regularly to share the status of each business unit's execution environment with relevant stakeholders.
