####Testing with Multiple PDU's  

>####When managing execution environments for PDU's, some challenges may arise:  

>Isolation: Each business unit may have different requirements, configurations, and dependencies, making it challenging to isolate and manage them effectively.  
>Version Control: Coordinating and tracking changes across multiple environments can become complicated, leading to potential conflicts.  
>Testing: Ensuring that changes do not adversely impact other business units while verifying the desired outcomes can be difficult.  
>Scalability: As the number of business units grows, it becomes crucial to have an efficient and scalable testing process.  


>####Best Practices for Testing Execution Environments  

>Implementing the Testing Process

>Define Test Scenarios
>Work with each business unit to identify critical test scenarios for their specific execution environment.   
Test scenarios should cover various use cases, configurations, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive testing.  

>Create Test Playbooks    
>Develop test playbooks using Ansible and molecule to simulate the defined test scenarios.   
These playbooks should cover all aspects of the business unit's execution environment and ensure that the configurations are correct and functional.  

>Execute Tests  
>Integrate the test playbooks into your CI/CD pipeline or run them manually against each business unit's environment.   
Monitor the test results and address any issues that arise during testing.  
  
>Monitoring and Reporting  
>Implement monitoring to keep track of the execution environment's health and performance.   
Utilize Ansible Tower or other monitoring tools to ensure the continuous operation of the infrastructure.   
Generate reports regularly to share the status of each business unit's execution environment with relevant stakeholders.
