>#### Use Debugging Modules  

>Ansible provides several built-in debugging modules that allow you to print information at runtime.   
>These modules can be helpful for inspecting variables, conditional statements, and overall playbook flow. Here are some commonly used debugging modules:  

> #### Debug module  
>The debug module allows you to print out variable values or custom messages during playbook execution.  
>You can use this module to verify the values of variables or troubleshoot conditional statements.  
> Here's an example:    
  
>```
>- name: Debug variable value
>   debug:
>     var: my_variable
>```

> #### ansible_facts module
>The ansible_facts module displays the gathered facts about remote systems.   
>You can use this module to inspect the system's environment and gather information that might be relevant for debugging purposes.   
> Here's an example:
>```
> - name: Display gathered facts
>    debug:
>      var: ansible_facts
>```
