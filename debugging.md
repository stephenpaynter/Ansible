#### Agree a format for the standard output of data from playbooks.  

>#### Use Debugging Modules  

>Ansible provides several built-in debugging modules that allow you to print information at runtime.   
>These modules can be helpful for inspecting variables, conditional statements, and overall playbook flow. Here are some commonly used debugging modules:  

> #### Debug module  
>The debug module allows you to print out variable values or custom messages during playbook execution.  
>You can use this module to verify the values of variables or troubleshoot conditional statements.  
> Here's an example:    
  
>```
>- name: Debug variable value
>   debug:
>     var: my_variable
>```

> #### Ansible_facts module
>The ansible_facts module displays the gathered facts about remote systems.   
>You can use this module to inspect the system's environment and gather information that might be relevant for debugging purposes.   
> Here's an example:
>```
> - name: Display gathered facts
>   debug:
>     var: ansible_facts
>```
>
> ####  Use Conditional Debugging
>
>Sometimes, you may only want to enable debugging for specific tasks or hosts to minimize the amount of output generated.   
>You can achieve this by using conditional statements and Ansible's when >keyword.   
>For example, you can set a variable that controls debugging and use it within tasks or playbooks.   
>Here's an example:
>```
> - name: Perform a task with debugging
>   debug:
>     msg: "Debugging is enabled!"
>   when: debug_enabled | default(false)
>```
>
> In this example, the task will only execute if the debug_enabled variable is set to true.  
> You can adjust the condition according to your specific needs.
