#### Agree a format for the standard output of data from playbooks.  

>#### Use Debugging Modules  

>Ansible provides several built-in debugging modules that allow you to print information at runtime.   
>These modules can be helpful for inspecting variables, conditional statements, and overall playbook flow. Here are some commonly used debugging modules:  

> #### Debug module  
>The debug module allows you to print out variable values or custom messages during playbook execution.  
>You can use this module to verify the values of variables or troubleshoot conditional statements.  
> Here's an example:    
  
>```
>- name: Debug variable value
>   debug:
>     var: my_variable
>```

> #### Ansible_facts module
>The ansible_facts module displays the gathered facts about remote systems.   
>You can use this module to inspect the system's environment and gather information that might be relevant for debugging purposes.   
> Here's an example:
>```
> - name: Display gathered facts
>   debug:
>     var: ansible_facts
>```
>
> ####  Use Conditional Debugging
>
>Sometimes, you may only want to enable debugging for specific tasks or hosts to minimize the amount of output generated.   
>You can achieve this by using conditional statements and Ansible's when >keyword.   
>For example, you can set a variable that controls debugging and use it within tasks or playbooks.   
>Here's an example:
>```
> - name: Perform a task with debugging
>   debug:
>     msg: "Debugging is enabled!"
>   when: debug_enabled | default(false)
>```
>
> In this example, the task will only execute if the debug_enabled variable is set to true.  
> You can adjust the condition according to your specific needs.  
>  
>   
> #### Debugging in AAP
>
> #### View Standard Out
>
> When running a playbook in Ansible Tower, you can view the standard output (stdout) of each task in real-time. This allows you to monitor the progress of the playbook execution and check for any >errors or unexpected output.
>
>To view the standard output in AAP, follow these steps:
>
> - Navigate to the "Jobs" section in the Ansible Tower web interface.  
> - Locate the job run that you want to debug and click on its name to open the job details.  
> - In the job details view, click on the "Standard Out" tab.  
> - The standard output of each task will be displayed, showing the module output, debug messages, and any other print statements within the playbook.
>  
>By reviewing the standard output, you can identify issues, inspect variable values, and gain insights into the playbook execution flow.
>
> Enable Job Notifications
>Ansible Tower allows you to configure job notifications, which can be helpful for debugging purposes.  
With job notifications enabled, AAP will send email or other notifications when a job encounters errors or fails to complete successfully.  
>  
>To set up job notifications in Ansible Tower, you need to configure notification settings in the Tower web interface. 
>This typically involves defining the email recipients, subject, and other relevant details. 
>When a job fails, you will receive a notification containing the error details, allowing you to quickly identify and resolve the issue.
