#### Variable Name Rules

Ansible has a strict set of rules to create valid variable names. Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores and must start with a letter or underscore.   
Some strings are reserved for other purposes and arenâ€™t valid variable names, such as Python Keywords or Playbook Keywords.  

>#### Best Practices for Using Variables and Variable Declaration in Ansible  

>Consistent Variable Naming:
>  
>Maintaining a consistent naming convention for variables improves readability and reduces confusion.   
>Consider using lowercase letters with underscores (_) to separate words in variable names. For example:  

>#### Bad practice
>myVariable = "value"

>#### Good practice
>my_variable = "value"

>Consistency is key, so choose a naming convention and apply it consistently throughout your playbooks.  

>#### Variable Declaration:  
Ansible provides multiple methods for declaring variables. Let's explore some best practices for each approach:  

>#### Inline Variable Declaration:
>Inline variable declaration can be useful for simple, short-lived variables.   
>However, it is recommended to limit its usage, especially for complex or lengthy expressions. Instead, prefer declaring variables using the vars keyword within a playbook or role. For example:  

>```
>- name: Inline variable declaration (avoid for complex expressions)
>  hosts: localhost
>  gather_facts: false
>  tasks:
>    - debug:
>        var: my_variable
>      vars:
>        my_variable: "value"
>```
>  
>#### Playbook-Level Variable Declaration:
>
>Defining variables at the playbook level using the vars keyword makes them accessible across all tasks within the playbook.  
>This approach helps maintain consistency and simplifies playbook maintenance.  

>For example:  

>```
>- name: Playbook-level variable declaration
>  hosts: localhost
>  gather_facts: false
>  vars:
>    my_variable: "value"
>  tasks:
>    - debug:
>        var: my_variable
>```

>#### Role-Level Variable Declaration:  
>When working with roles, declare variables within the defaults/main.yml file of the role.  
>This ensures that the variables are accessible within the role and can be easily overridden by users.   

>For example:
>  
>```
># Role: my_role
># Path: roles/my_role/defaults/main.yml
>
>my_variable: "default_value"
>```

>#### Variable Precedence and Overriding:  
>Ansible follows a specific order of precedence when resolving variables. Understanding this order is essential to ensure desired variable values.  
>The order of precedence, from highest to lowest, is as follows:     
>Variables defined explicitly in the task.    
>Variables passed through the vars section of the playbook.  
>Variables defined within the role's defaults/main.yml.  
>Variables provided through inventory, including host_vars and group_vars.  
>To override variables at runtime, pass them as extra variables using the -e flag or through an inventory file.   

>For example:
>  
>```
ansible-playbook my_playbook.yml -e "my_variable=new_value"  
>```
>  
>#### Variable Encryption:
>Sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or private keys should be encrypted when stored in variables. 
>Ansible provides the ansible-vault command to encrypt and decrypt files containing sensitive data. Avoid storing plaintext sensitive information in variable files or playbooks.  
  
>#### Variable Files and Organization:  
>Organizing variable files can greatly improve playbook maintenance and readability. Consider the following recommendations:  
>Use separate variable files for different environments or specific roles.  
>Group related variables within the same file.  
>Use the group_vars and host_vars directories to store variables specific to groups or individual hosts, respectively.
